<h3>Hello, everyone!</h3>
<p>My name is Nina Rose and this is my personal portfolio website. I’m so excited to have this space to share my work. First, though, here’s a little bit about me:
I’m a student at the University of Minnesota pursuing a BA in Russian studies and a BS in Technical Writing & Communication as well as a minor in English. Needless to say, I love reading, writing, and exploring the complexities of rhetoric. I also love creative writing and especially enjoy writing and reading poetry.</p>
<p>As far as my Russian studies go, learning the Russian language has been a true labor of love in my life. I grew up in a half Russian household and was always surrounded by the language to a certain extent, but never really learned how to speak. I grew interested in connecting to my roots, though, thanks to the Concordia Language Villages in Bemidji, Minnesota. Then upon learning about my own culture, I became interested in in learning about other Russian-speaking cultures. This eventually culminated in me spending a gap year in the former Soviet Republic of Moldova. I lived in the capital city of Chisinau for 10 months. It was one of the richest and most eye-opening experiences in my life so far. I have gone on to major in Russian in college and am deeply involved with the Russian Speaking Community on the University of Minnesota campus. I am even the current president of our Russian Speaking Student Association. I also worked as a student translator for the history department on campus.</p>
<p> Along with my interests in literary and language arts, I also love film. It works with so many different mediums - technology, writing, visual arts, and storytelling. I myself am always looking to improve my skills as a storyteller, whether it be in a creative or technical environment, and becoming engrossed in a movie allows me to take in all these moving elements. Also, just like with books, you can travel all around the world just by watching movies. I love traveling with all my heart, but during times when that is not an option - such as during a global pandemic - I can still learn so much about the world around me.<pa>
<p>Another very important thing about me is that I am very interested in mindset work and personal growth. I love exercising, meditation, and implementing positive habits to improve my overall health and quality of life. A growth mindset means everything to me. My involvement with the University of Minnesota CHAARG Chapter has been pivotal in my wellness journey. CHAARG is a national movement across US college campuses that encourages college-aged girls "ditch the elliptical" and find a vast array of fitness and wellness resources that they will enjoy while also building community. I have been so lucky to be a member of my university's chapter where I participate in workshops, weekly community workouts, and lead a small group workout myself each week. CHAARG has offered me opportunities to grow both physically and professionally and these skills will stay with me moving forward into a bright future.</p>
